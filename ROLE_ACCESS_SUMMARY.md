## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Customer Management**: Both roles can ONLY view customers. Customers are managed through the frontend registration process.

2. **Admin User Management**: Only Superadmin can see and manage admin users.

3. **Self-Protection**: Superadmin cannot delete their own account.

4. **Role Assignment**: When Superadmin creates a new user, they can assign either 'admin' or 'superadmin' role.

5. **Navigation**: Admin users will not see the "Admin Users" menu item at all.
